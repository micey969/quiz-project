# Basic Quiz App from @python_developers on ig


### This application is a simple quiz. It was modified to add @staff_member_required to the view so that only admin users would be able to access the link to add questions. Questions can also be added in the admin dashboard.

### Once a user clicks submit, they are presented with their score and a count of the correct answers, incorrect answers and the total questions.
